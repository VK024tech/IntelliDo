IntelliDo Privacy Policy
Last Updated: May 01, 2025

Introduction

This Privacy Policy applies to IntelliDo, a personal portfolio project developed by vivek  to demonstrate programming skills. IntelliDo uses Google OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users and access Gmail data for educational purposes. This policy outlines how user data is handled in this non-commercial project.

Data Collection

IntelliDo collects the following data via Google OAuth when users sign in:

Profile Information: Name and email address.
Gmail Data: Read-only access to email messages (via the gmail.readonly scope) for testing and demonstration.
This data is only collected during user authentication and interaction with the app.
Data Usage

The collected data is used solely for:

Authenticating users to demonstrate the app’s functionality.
Testing and showcasing Gmail integration features as part of the portfolio project.
No data is used for commercial purposes, advertising, or analytics.
Data Sharing

As a portfolio project, user data is not shared with third parties. It is accessed and processed only by me for the purposes outlined above. No data is sold or transferred to external entities.

Data Security

Basic security measures are in place to protect user data, including:

Data is processed in memory during runtime and not persistently stored.
The app is hosted on a secure platform (Vercel) with HTTPS encryption.
However, since this is a portfolio project, robust long-term storage or advanced security measures are not implemented.
User Rights

Users can revoke IntelliDo’s access to their Google data at any time via their Google Account settings:

Go to myaccount.google.com/permissions, find IntelliDo, and remove access.
No personal data deletion request process is available, as data is not persistently stored.
